#  HRnet

HRnet is an online application for managing your team. Project 14 of the OpenClassrooms "Web app developer - JavaScript React" course. For this project I'm using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/), and [redux-toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/).

I had to refactor an [old JQuery site](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P12_Front-end) into a modern React app. I published independently this custom Modal as a [new NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-react-modal-plugin), but most of the work is in the [HRnet website main repository](https://github.com/JyjyStudio/hrnet).
